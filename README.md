### The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container (Note that its width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes)
### The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport (width is always 100%)

# Container Padding
<div class="container pt-5"></div>
### (By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding")

# Container Border and Color
<div class="container p-5 my-5 border"></div>
<div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-dark text-white"></div>
<div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-primary text-white"></div>
